        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>As a Software Engineer and Computer Science student at the University of Victoria, I've developed a passion for creating impactful software solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.</p>
                
                <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                <div class="experience-story">
                    <h4>Siteability - Full-Stack Software Developer Co-op</h4>
                    <p>My time at Siteability has been transformative. Working on the NUXT 3 platform, I've had the opportunity to tackle complex challenges in property management software. One of my most rewarding achievements was improving the platform's compatibility from 80% to over 99% of properties in pilot municipalities, making the software accessible to more users than ever before.</p>
                    <p>What I love most about my role is the opportunity to work in a cross-functional team, where I can combine technical expertise with user-centered design thinking to create better solutions.</p>

                <h3>Education & Growth</h3>
                <div class="education-story">
                    <h4>University of Victoria</h4>
                    <p>My journey at UVic has been about more than just coursework. As a member of the AI Club, I've been able to explore cutting-edge technologies and collaborate with like-minded peers. The co-op program has been instrumental in bridging the gap between academic learning and real-world application.</p>
                    <p>Key courses in Software Development, Algorithms, and Database Systems have given me a strong foundation, while my work experience has taught me how to apply these concepts in practical scenarios.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies. I believe in the importance of staying current with industry trends and best practices, which is why I actively participate in tech communities and contribute to open-source projects.</p>
